During this lesson, I learned that Git is a version control system for all files. 
I also learned that not using Git means:
losing your work, 
having a chaotic file system, 
not having a work history, 
and being afraid to try new things.
During this lesson, I also learned the key concepts of GIT, which are: 
the repository, the staging area, and commit.
I am learning Git fundamentals.
Git tracks every change I make.
I can commit my work to save progress.
I just pushed my first repo to Github!
